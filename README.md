## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. Below are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
-  numpy
-  pandas
-  matplotlib
-  seaborn


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

In this project, I use the Seattle Airbnb Data to better understand on the following:
1. Which are the property_type in Seattle Airbnb and the price range?
2. Which room type/ property type are more popular - based on the availability_90 column?
3. What factors may affect the price and booking rate?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. Seattle Airbnb Dataset.ipynb Jupyter notebook 
2. listings.csv 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@chriswongpy/analysis-over-the-seattle-airbnb-open-data-fa221375d60d).
